= RENDER INHERITABLE

A Rails plugin that allows one to inherit or override single partials and templates for controller subclasses.

This gem gives you inheritable views and partials. In the default case, a template is searched in the current controller's view folder. If it is not found there, the template with the same name in the view folder of the superclass controller is used. This lookup path might be customized as well.
